# Good Heart

Clojure interpreter on pure Ruby. Now supports only the small subset.

_**The Wizard of Oz:** As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart. You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable._

_**The Tin Man:** But, I... I still want one._

## For what?
1. It's just awesome.
2. Share logic between Clojure and Ruby apps in stack.
2. Gradually migrate from Ruby to Clojure (or back).
3. Ability to create some tooling for Clojure on Ruby.
